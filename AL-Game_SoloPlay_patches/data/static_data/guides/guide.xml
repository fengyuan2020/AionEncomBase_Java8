			Beritra's invasion monsters will appear in some regions at certain times.
			Beritra has researched ancient Danuar weapons ever since discovering Ide and Hyperion in Katalam.
			Deep within the Sauro Supply Base was a hidden cache of Danuar weapon designs and machine parts.
			Beritra used this new technology to create legions of highly advanced autonomous weapons, which he
			uses to sow chaos and Balaurea, Abyss, and even Elysea and Asmodae.
			<br><br><br><br>
			Walk strong. Let blood boil within your veins, and use

			The items can be purchased in the Walk of Fame/Hall of Fame in the academies of each race.

			I see Balaurea has been treating you well, my friend!
			I have not seen Gelkmaros myself just yet, but my network of 
			contacts has provided me with more than enough information 
			to help you along your path.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Taloc is, by all accounts, the greatest Elim that ever existed.
			He towers above the tallest building, such is the power of the 
			Aether tangled in his mighty roots. 
			But the Aether has also corrupted the creatures within Taloc.
			They have been driven insane by their lust for Taloc's sap,
			and the great Elim is now in desperate need of help.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			I have also heard of a place in Gelkmaros called the Udas Temple.
			Rumor has it that the two areas there are extremely difficult,
			and that you will need to work with your fellow Daevas to get
			through them alive. Similarly, the Archons in Balaurea have
			discovered a second Dredgion. It needs destroying.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			As Last but not least, I believe you would do well to pay Garath
			in Gelkmaros Fortress a visit.
			He will be able to help you unlock new power!
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Be well, friend. I will be watching your progress.

			Still marching on, aren't we ? You've reached an
			impressive milestone today, my friend. But as
			before, the Asmodian does not dwell on what he has
			done, but what there is to do. And there is plenty.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Kaldor:
			roils and groans with the consequences of an ancient mistake.
			Cinder-ridden forests choke on the ashen reminders of the dangers of Ide.
			This place is a struggle between a petrified memory of old, and the growth of a new age trying to forget.
			Anoha, a forgotten Danuar hero, stands at the heart of it all.
			His ancient blade, sunken into the stone of Wealhtheow Keep, may hold the answers to how Kaldor met its end.
			As lava belches forth onto this Ide-soaked land from the depths, Beritra moves across Kaldor with purpose.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Levinshor:
			The lush land of Levinshor belies a terrible secret,
			for long ago it was Tiamat seat of power prior to her ascension as a dragon lord.
			It had long been sealed away by a powerful barrier, but with Tiamat demise,
			Beritra was able to dispel the barrier and take control of Levinshor for his own purposes.
			Specifically, he desired the fruits of the Linkgate Foundry research.
			Seeing Beritra troops on the move, the Elyos and Asmodian forces realized
			the barrier must’ve been removed, and began their own incursions
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			As ever, I have something for you! Thank me later.

			Panesterra was once the domain of the ancient Danuar.
			The cataclysmic explosion that destroyed Kaldor was so powerful that the fabric of
			reality was ripped apart, and Panesterra vanished into another dimension.
			Desperate to return home, the Danuar that were pulled with it gathered as much Ide
			as they could muster, but the plan backfired; instead of returning home,
			the land bent and split, becoming nothing more than islands floating in a void.
			Now, with the power of the Linkgate Foundry, Beritra has invaded Panesterra, intent on exploiting its secrets.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Panesterra sieges will be open periodically.
			- Entrances become available in the Hall of Fame and Walk of Fame areas at the
			appointed time and remain spawned for ten minutes, or until all spots are filled

			So you heve survived this far. I excepted you to, but i did
			not expect you to reach these heights quite so quickly. I
			am impressed, my friend! But, with each surpassed
			milestone comes a slew of fresh challenges.
			<br><br><br><br>
			A ship known as the Steel Rake is careering through the
			skies above as you read this. Its Shulack crew don't care
			for either Elyos or Asmodians, and kidnap and torture you
			kin on a daily basis. Stop them. Alternatively, you are now
			ready to finish up your work in Heiron or take on the
			Lower Abyss Treasure Rooms.
			<br><br><br><br>
			But combat isn't all that's available for you now, no! New
			skills are ready to be unlocked, and you are now ready to
			undertake the expert test in a profession of your choosing.
			<br><br><br><br>
			Faith and arms!

			Beritra's invasion monsters will appear in some regions at certain times.
			Beritra has researched ancient Danuar weapons ever since discovering Ide and Hyperion in Katalam.
			Deep within the Sauro Supply Base was a hidden cache of Danuar weapon designs and machine parts.
			Beritra used this new technology to create legions of highly advanced autonomous weapons, which he
			uses to sow chaos and Balaurea, Abyss, and even Elysea and Asmodae.
			<br><br><br><br>
			Walk strong. Let blood boil within your veins, and use
			the steel of our spirit to strengthen your conviction. The
			cowards will fall before you like Asmodians flowers under
			Elyos rain.

			The items can be purchased in the Walk of Fame/Hall of Fame in the academies of each race.

			Still marching on, aren't we ? You've reached an

			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Kaldor:
			roils and groans with the consequences of an ancient mistake.
			Cinder-ridden forests choke on the ashen reminders of the dangers of Ide.
			This place is a struggle between a petrified memory of old, and the growth of a new age trying to forget.
			Anoha, a forgotten Danuar hero, stands at the heart of it all.
			His ancient blade, sunken into the stone of Wealhtheow Keep, may hold the answers to how Kaldor met its end.
			As lava belches forth onto this Ide-soaked land from the depths, Beritra moves across Kaldor with purpose.
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			Levinshor:
			The lush land of Levinshor belies a terrible secret,
			for long ago it was Tiamat seat of power prior to her ascension as a dragon lord.
			It had long been sealed away by a powerful barrier, but with Tiamat demise,
			Beritra was able to dispel the barrier and take control of Levinshor for his own purposes.
			Specifically, he desired the fruits of the Linkgate Foundry research.
			Seeing Beritra troops on the move, the Elyos and Asmodian forces realized
			the barrier must’ve been removed, and began their own incursions
			<Br><Br><Br><Br>
			As ever, I have something for you! Thank me later.

			Panesterra was once the domain of the ancient Danuar.
			The cataclysmic explosion that destroyed Kaldor was so powerful that the fabric of
